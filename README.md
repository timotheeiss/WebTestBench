## 📖 Overall

The rise of "vibe coding" enables developers to rapidly build complete web applications through natural language instructions, but this introduces a critical question: how do we automatically verify that AI-generated web functionalities are correctly implemented?

**WebTestBench** is a benchmark designed for evaluating computer-use agents on end-to-end automated web testing. It grounds evaluation in realistic AI-driven web development scenarios and goes beyond standard functional checks to assess latent logical constraints — nuanced behavioral rules such as permission boundaries and business logic that are often invisible in the interface but critical to software quality.

Key features include:
- Web applications spanning 7 diverse application categories
- Evaluation dimensions: Functionality, Constraint, Interaction, and Content
- WebTester, a two-stage baseline framework consisting of:
  - Checklist Generation Agent — automatically generates a structured test checklist from the development instruction
  - Defect Detection Agent — interacts with the application to detect defects against the checklist

## 🔍 Dataset

**Example**

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/data_example.png" width="80%">
</p>

All web projects can be deployed via:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
You may use this to preview the applications manually, but no pre-deployment is needed before evaluation. Automatic deployment and teardown are handled within the evaluation code.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

- Python `>=3.11`
- Node.js `18+` (required by Claude Code)
- A valid API key for your provider (for example, OpenRouter)

**1) Python Environment**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2) Install Claude Code, Playwright MCP, and Claude Agent SDK**

Please read the official Claude Code quickstart first:
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart

<details>
<summary>Shortcut commands</summary>

```bash
# Install Claude Code (Node.js 18+)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# First-time login
claude
# Complete login in the CLI, then exit
/exit

# Add Playwright MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add playwright npx @playwright/mcp@0.0.61  # Do not use @playwright/mcp@latest
npx playwright install

# Claude Agent SDK (already included in requirements.txt)
pip install claude-agent-sdk
```

</details>

⚠️ **Note on Playwright MCP Version**
Do not use `@playwright/mcp@latest` for now. The latest version may cause Claude Code to fail when accessing Playwright MCP. [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/1359)

**Verify Playwright MCP Availability**
```bash
claude mcp list
```
Example Output:
```
playwright: npx @playwright/mcp@0.0.61 - ✓ Connected
```
If you change the Playwright MCP version, make sure to update the corresponding version in `eval/agent/claude_code.py` (specifically in ClaudeAgentOptions) to keep them consistent.

**3) Configure OpenRouter for API Models**

We use OpenRouter to access and route requests to different models, but other providers are also supported.

For OpenRouter integration, follow the official guide:
- https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/coding-agents/claude-code-integration

<details>
<summary>Configure <code>.claude.json</code> for OpenRouter</summary>

Add the following configuration to your local `.claude.json` file (on macOS, located at `/Users/{user_name}/.claude.json`). Locate the active project entry under `"projects"`, such as `"xxx/WebTestBench"`, and update its `"env"` section to include the OpenRouter settings below.

```json
"env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://openrouter.ai/api", 
    "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-or-v1-xxx", 
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": ""  // remain an empty string
}
```

A complete example is shown here:
```json
"xxx/WebTestBench": {
  "allowedTools": [],
  "mcpContextUris": [],
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@0.0.61"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://openrouter.ai/api",
        "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "sk-or-v1-xxx",
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": ""  // remain an empty string
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Evaluation

Before running, edit each script with your local settings (`API_BASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, `MODEL`, dataset paths, etc.).

<details>
<summary>API and Model setup example</summary>

```bash
export API_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api"
export API_KEY="<YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY>"
export MODEL="openai/gpt-5.2"  # It is recommended to first use a low-cost model with agentic capabilities to successfully run a single sample.

export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL="$MODEL"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL="$MODEL"
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL="$MODEL"
```

> **This fork runs only the defect-detection (gold) task**, under two conditions
> — `baseline` (accessibility tree) vs `hints` (semantic-hints MCP). The upstream
> two-stage tester and judge scorer are retired to `scripts/legacy/`. Results and
> analysis live in the top-level `../experiments/` tree, not in this fork —
> see [`../experiments/README.md`](../experiments/README.md) for the full spec.

#### The A/B pipeline (this fork)

```bash
# 1. Run baseline + hints over apps 0001–0005 (env-overridable: RUN_ID, APPS, REPS, MODEL)
bash scripts/run_suite.sh
#    -> ../experiments/runs/<run-id>/{baseline,hints}/WebTestBench_00XX/rep<r>/

# 2. Score every condition/rep leaf with the deterministic oracle scorer
bash scripts/score_suite.sh <run-id>

# 3. Aggregate accuracy + efficiency into the comparison tables
python ../experiments/analysis/aggregate.py --run_dir ../experiments/runs/<run-id>
#    -> summary/{scores.csv, efficiency.csv, report.md}
```

Each run writes a `run_config.json` manifest (model, apps, reps, turn budget,
git SHAs) so it is reproducible from that file alone.

### Scripts overview (`scripts/`)

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `run_suite.sh` | A/B suite: baseline + hints over `APPS` × `REPS`, one run-id, visible browser. Writes `../experiments/runs/<run-id>/` + `run_config.json`. |
| `score_suite.sh <run-id>` | Score every `<condition>/rep<r>` leaf of a run with the oracle scorer (`eval/scoring_oracle.py`). |
| `dump_agent_view.py` | Replay a run's SDK session transcript to dump exactly what the agent saw (accessibility tree / hints) and did (tool calls). |
| `legacy/` | Dismissed / superseded scripts (upstream two-stage tester, judge scorer, single-app runners). See `scripts/legacy/README.md`. |

Analysis lives one level up in [`../experiments/analysis/`](../experiments/analysis/); the live-vs-legacy map for `eval/` is in [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md).
